# CloudFlare Dynamic DNS Updater

This is an extremely simple tool to update CloudFlare dynamic DNS entries. It's
sole purpose is to periodically query the external IP address of the machine it
is running on, and modify the DNS entry accordingly. Opposed to a few scripts
out there that do a one shot update requiring regular cron sheduling, this one
is more aimed to environments where you can configure it as a service and leave
the updater running in the background.

## Installation and usage

The tool in written in Go and follows the usual installation method:

```
$ go get github.com/karalabe/cloudflare-dyndns
```

```
$ cloudflare-dyndns --help

Usage of cloudflare-dyndns:
  -domains string
    	Comma separated domain list to update
  -interface string
    	Obtain external IP using the specified interface
  -key string
    	CloudFlare authorization token
  -mail string
    	Delivery notifications via this mail server (optional)
  -ttl int
    	Domain time to live value (default 120)
  -update duration
    	Time interval to run the updater (default 1m0s)
  -user string
    	CloudFlare username to update with
```

## Running from Docker

The CloudFlare updater is available as a Docker container too in the form of a
Docker Hub automated build. To use it, simply pull the images and start with the
same flags you would use for the standalone version.

```
$ docker pull karalabe/cloudflare-dyndns
$ docker run -d --restart=always karalabe/cloudflare-dyndns [...]
```

Above we've also set a restart policy to always start up the DNS updates even in
the face of complete machine reboots.
